# **Hey there!** 👋

## **Welcome to my GitHub!** 🚀

I'm Sahil, a networking enthusiast and Python programmer who’s deeply in love with networks, automation, and security. I enjoy breaking down complex infrastructures, automating boring network tasks, and experimenting with how code can make networks smarter, faster, and more secure. If it involves routers, switches, scripts, or packets flying around, I’m already interested. 😌
